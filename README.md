# belly-button-challenge

This project analyzed a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

	•	An interactive dashboard was created that consists of a drop down menu where the user can view the results by subject id.
	•	When a subject id is created a horizontal bar graph is created that displays the operational taxonomic units (OTU’s).
	•	A metadata chart was also created that shows the subjects demographic information. The chart also changes to match the user’s selection.
